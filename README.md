# Fresh-Prince
In West Philadelphia born and raised on the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chilling out maxin'relaxin' all cool and all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of boys who were up to no good, started makin' trouble in my neighbourhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, she said you codin' in C# and thats all I care
